TSP Project Part 4 - Reilly Cannon only

I used the previous week's solutions for this assignment.

There are no special compilation instructions. I compiled everything with just the include Makefile.

Parameters: 2 million iterations, pop_size of 1000, 0.3 mutation_rate

The best result I found was 5862.06.

Run Time of best result (4 threads): 4.92 seconds (using timing method from class, see code).
Single-Thread Runtime: around 12-14 seconds.
